# Online Code Submission Tool - IDE

## An online IDE that can be used as a unified testing environment
  - Test your problem solving skills by tackling common coding challenges 
  - Test your SQL skills by querying a database
  - Test your front-end skills with a CodePen clone

### Technologies used:
1. C# - ASP.NET
2. Blazor
3. SQL Server
4. Html
5. Css
6. JavaScript

We expose a back-end API that our Blazor front-end consumes
  - I think it's worth noting that our back-end is completely decoupled from the front-end
  
### Currently available languages:
1. Python
2. SQL
3. Html/Css/JavaScript
